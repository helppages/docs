# Nifty Features
In addition to the basic functionality that makes up HelpPag.es, there are a few additional features that are pretty nifty, but don't quite fit into the categories anywhere else.

## External Github Repos
If you need to include an external github repo in your docs, you can do so by creating a file in your docs repo that links to the github repository.  For example:

```
github:helppages/stylesheet-template
```
