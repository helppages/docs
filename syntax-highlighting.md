# Syntax Highlighting
HelpPag.es has built in support for beautiful syntax highlighting on your code.  All you need to do is utilize the github markdown fenced-code syntax and let us know what language you're using.  We'll take care of the rest.

## Example


    ```ruby
      def say_hi(name)
        # comments get handled too!
        "Hello #{name}"
      end
     ```


yields:

```ruby
def say_hi(name)
  # comments get handled too!
  "Hello #{name}"
end
```
