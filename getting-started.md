# Getting Started
Getting started with HelpPag.es is easy - just 2 steps!
## 1. Start a public repo on GitHub

HelpPag.es expects your docs to be stored in a public repo on GitHub.

> **Why public?**  
> We think a public repo is a great options for hosting docs, it allows your community to contribute.  We also didn't want to request any more GitHub privileges than we needed.  If you'd like a private repo, let us know - we can enable it on a per-account basis.

## 2. Write your docs in Markdown

Markdown is a really great language for writing documentation.  You can learn more about the syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) or check out our docs for inspiration [here](https://github.com/helppages/docs).

## 3. That's it!

Once your docs have been pushed to github, let us know where they are and we'll keep them up to date for your docs.
