# Getting Started
Getting started with HelpPag.es is easy - just 2 steps!
## Start a public repo on GitHub
HelpPag.es expects your docs to be stored in a public repo on GitHub.  
### Why public?  
Why not?  We think your users should be able to contribute to your docs if they'd like.  If you need private repo support, let us know - we can enable it on a per-user basis.

## Write your docs in Markdown
Markdown is a really great language for writing documentation.  You can learn more about the syntax [here](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) or check out our docs for inspiration [here](https://github.com/helppages/docs).

## That's it!
Once your docs have been pushed to github, let us know where they are and we'll keep them up to date for your docs.
