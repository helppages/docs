# Custom Domain

HelpPag.es lets you setup a custom domain for your docs if you'd like. For example, you could set your docs to be available at `http://docs.your-domain.com`.  To do so, head on over to the [dashboard](http://dashboard.helppag.es) and click the `settings` tab.  Next, just add the docs domain you'll want to use and click save.

## Setting up your domain
While that's all there is to it from the helppag.es side, there's a bit more setup involved with your domain registrar.  You'll want to setup a new DNS entry that creates a `CNAME` value and points to `http://your-subdomain.helppag.es`.  If you need some help getting this setup, let us know on our [GitHub feedback repo](https://github.com/helppages/feedback/issues) by submitting a new issue.
