# HelpPag.es
The quickest way to release beautiful, easily understood documentation.

## The Gist
[HelpPag.es](http://www.helppag.es) was built for people like us, who:

 * think docs should be written in Markdown
 * already have their favorite text editors
 * think github is simply amazing
 * can't believe there wasn't already an awesome solution for this

## The Workflow
Getting docs into HelpPag.es is easy.  Simply write them locally in Markdown using your favorite editor, push them into a public github repo and tell us where to pull them from.  We'll make them browsable, searchable, beautiful and sprinkle in some awesome analytics.  Your docs can live at your domain and will always kept up to date as you push changes to the repo.

## Custom Theming
While we provide several awesome themes out of the box, we also offer some powerful theming capabilities.  To use them, simply drop a css file in your docs repo.  We'll take care of the rest.

To get started with custom themeing, head over to our [custom theme github repo](https://github.com/helppages/stylesheet-template).  There you'll find a stylesheet template and even a test html file to see how your docs will look once the template is uploaded.

## Can I use a private repo?
No, but only because we didn't think you'd want to.  We wanted to avoid asking for more GitHub permissions than we needed, so we limited it to just public repos.  We'd actually recommend that you keep your docs in a public repo anyways so your users can get engaged and help you keep them up to date.  If you're really interested in using a private repo, [let us know](https://github.com/helppages/feedback/issues) and we'll look at upping our permissions level for you.
