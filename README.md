# The Gist
[HelpPag.es](http://www.helppag.es) is the quickest way to release beautiful, easily understood documentation.  We built for people like us, who:

 * think docs should be written in Markdown
 * already have their favorite text editors
 * think github is simply amazing
 * can't believe there wasn't already an awesome solution for this

## The Workflow
Getting docs into HelpPag.es is easy.  Simply write them locally in Markdown using your favorite editor, push them into a public github repo and tell us where to pull them from.  We'll make them browsable, searchable, beautiful and sprinkle in some awesome analytics.  Your docs can live at your domain and will always kept up to date as you push changes to the repo.

### Theming
While we provide several awesome themes out of the box, we also offer some powerful theming capabilities.  To use them, simply drop a css file in your docs repo.  We'll take care of the rest.

To get started with custom theming, head over to the [Themes Section](/theming.md).

### The Dashboard
Once you've given us your GitHub repo, you're done - there's no need to do anything else.  There are, however, a few features that you may want to take advantage of on our dashboard.  You can learn about them in the [Dashboard Section](/exploring-the-dashboard.md).

## Common Questions
### Can I use a private repo?
No, but only because we didn't think you'd want to.  We wanted to avoid asking for more GitHub permissions than we needed, so we limited it to just public repos.  We'd actually recommend that you keep your docs in a public repo anyways so your users can get engaged and help you keep them up to date.  If you're really interested in using a private repo, [let us know](https://github.com/helppages/feedback/issues) and we'll look at upping our permissions level for you.

### Can I submit suggestions / feedback / complaints?
Absolutely.  Just head on over to our [GitHub feedback repo](https://github.com/helppages/feedback/issues) and submit a new issue.
